[unet](src/introduction.md) is a [distributed operating system](src/distributed-operating-system.md) in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). It provides a uniform cross-platform [CLI](src/cli.md) and [API](src/api.md) for the [cloud](src/platforms/cloud), the [browser](src/platforms/browser), [mobile](src/platforms/mobile) and [IoT](src/platforms/iot).
