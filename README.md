[unet](src/introduction.md) is a [distributed operating system](src/distributed-operating-system.md) in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). It provides a uniform cross-platform [CLI](src/cli.md) and [API](src/api.md) for the [cloud](src/platforms/cloud.md), the [browser](src/platforms/browser.md), [mobile](src/platforms/mobile.md) and [IoT](src/platforms/iot.md). Using unet, you can write distributed applications with a common code base in Rust that can run across all [supported platforms](src/platforms).
