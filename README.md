## Installation and Setup

Installation instructions for the unet client are available on our [Installation page](https://unet.tech/docs/installation.html).

## Building the Client

The unet client uses `cargo`, Rust's package manager and build system, for building from source. Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed by following the [Rust Installation Guide].

To build the client, use the following command in the root of the source directory:

```sh
cargo build --release
```
