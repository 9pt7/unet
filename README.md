[unet](src/introduction.md) is a distributed operating system in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). It provides a uniform cross-platform [CLI](src/main.md) and [API](src/lib.md) for the [cloud](src/platforms/cloud), the [browser](src/platforms/browser), [mobile](src/platforms/mobile) and [IoT](src/platforms/iot). Using unet, you can write distributed applications with a common code base in Rust that can run across all [supported platforms](src/platforms).
