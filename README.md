[unet](https://unet.tech) is a Linux userspace program written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) that makes many machines appear as a single virtual machine. It scales to millions of simultaneous client connections. unet supports storage and transmission of data through files. The files are hosted on a distributed filesystem so data can be shared between host servers and clients. Nearly any computer with a public internet connection can connect to unet, allowing unet to support a range of [use cases](/src/use-cases.md). Using unet, you can write scalable network applications fully in Rust that runs across all [supported platforms](src/platforms). Users control how their data is shared. It is free for anyone to sign up to unet, so it is important that permissions are properly managed.
