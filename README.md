unet
====

[unet](https://unet.tech) lets you run a network application on a single virtual machine by making many machines appear as a single machine, scaling to millions of simultaneous connections. unet has a distributed filesystem so data can be shared. Nearly any computer with an Internet connection can connect to unet, allowing unet to support a range of [use cases](/src/use-cases.md).
